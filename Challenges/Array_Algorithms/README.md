## Array Algorithms Challenge

Try to develop the algorithms to implement these functions on your own, without looking up solutions online.
It's okay if your solutions are not perfect yet. We are trying to improve our own design abilities right now, not our ability to read other people's code.

```
search (int[] haystack, int needle) {
    returns the index of any needle found in the haystack
    return -1 if index is not found
    If there are multiple of the "needle", then return the index of the first one found
}
```

```
sort (int[] data) {
    design an algorithm that uses swaps to rearrange the data to be in ascending order
}
```

### BONUS:
Which class of algorithm does your solution fit into? Is there a faster way to solve the problem?
